## Usage

### Installing

```
yarn add -D jest-chance
```

```
npm install -D jest-chance
```

### Add to Jest

To have a random seed for each test execution, we need to tell Jest to use this library.

In your `package.json`, add the following:

```json
"jest": {
  "globalSetup": "jest-chance"
}
```

### Replace chance in your tests

Within your tests, you might have something like this:
>**Old Chance usage, don't copy this**
>```js 
>import Chance from 'chance';
>const chance = new Chance();
>```

This will be replaced by our new package's offering:

```js
import { chance } from 'jest-chance'; 
```

This will do 2 things:
1. it will acquire a seed to use
2. will return you a chance object primed with said seed
  
###Â Using with a fixed seed

Sometimes you would need deterministic generators. 
For that reason, you can use the method: `getChance(seed?)`

```js
import { getChance } from 'jest-chance';

const deterministicChance = getChance('a-fixed-seed');
 
```
  
### Watch your logs

When you run your tests, jest will tell you something like this:
```
Using Chance Seed: 534a873a618e4e317060f9bc29f9115ad156168b
```

This is the piece of information you need to replay the tests with the same values.

### Replaying the tests

Set the `CHANCE_SEED` environment variable to the seed you got in the console previously
```
$ CHANCE_SEED=534a873a618e4e317060f9bc29f9115ad156168b jest
```
